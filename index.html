                We empower legal professionals by turning complex data analysis from a bottleneck into a competitive edge. Our initial focus is on providing high-value analysis for competition law, specializing in local market and remedy assessments for merger cases.

                <strong>Security-First Principle:</strong> We build our tools with a security-first mindset. Third-party AI is never applied to client data.

                <p>
                    Years of experience in high-stakes merger reviews at a top law firm revealed the same bottleneck again and again: critical strategic decisions were being hampered by slow, inefficient data analysis. I founded Dex Intelligence to solve that problem.

                <p>
                    My background is at the intersection of law, economics, and technology. With a degree in applied mathematics, MA in economics, and doctoral work in empirical industrial organization, my focus has always been on using quantitative methods—including building structural econometric models in Python—to answer complex questions about market behaviour. My mission is to bring that analytical power directly to legal professionals, turning data from a burden into your most powerful asset.
